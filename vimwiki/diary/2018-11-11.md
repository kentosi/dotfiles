# Jut got back from Matt Overall's place

I need to sort a few things out in my head.

I got a job offer at N26 and I want to take it but I also have things holding me back:
- Maybe I should stick it out at Dstillery for another 4 months till I hit the 180 days of the I-140
- What if I don't cut it and get fired?

Well.. that's about it really when all my doubts boil down.

The good possibilities are that:
- I'm earning a good amount more.
- I am working in an internation organisation.
- I have made it clear that I want to travel and become a manager.
- There's a potential to learn Kotlin

So let's address the downsides:
- The green card will come. You don't really need to worry about it until AFTER your next H1B extention.
- If you get fired, well, you find another job. You reevaluate. That's it.

I will do whichever interviews remain, but I think that my mind it made up.
